# mfgdocs
Produce simple documentation for any manufacturing process.

The idea is to create a json/yaml storage format for version control that is then translated into graphviz for visualization.

This application contains a visual editor for the manufacturing steps and provides integration to manufacturing systems, but the output is a version controlled text based repository containing all the information necessary for manufacturing.
